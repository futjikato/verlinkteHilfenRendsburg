                            <p>Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. You enjoyed that. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Besides, you look good in a dress. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir.</p>
